This is the repository for datasets for my research on how LGBTQ+ bills in Texas Congress affects LGBTQ+ resources in Harris County.

The SAMPLE_DATA_CSVS_APRIL_2025 folder includes sample datasets that were used during my HONS 4350 proposal presentation. These datasets will not be updated as of 04/29/2025. The proposal presentation and report will be available to view on this repository soon.

The DATA_CSVS_OCTOBER_2025 folder includes datasets that were used for the development of my HONS 4355 research. Original sample datasets were edited, renamed, and/or consolidated; some files that were in the SAMPLE_DATA_CSVS_APRIL_2025 folder may not have carried over. This is currently still being updated as of 10/20/2025.

The DATA_DICTIONARY lists all the values of the variables of the DATA_CSVS_OCTOBER_2025 datasets. This includes definitions of category variables and variable values. This is currently still being updated as of 10/20/2025.
